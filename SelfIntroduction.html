    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Finta. I currently work as a Business Process Analyst at a Internet Service Provider company. The reason I decided to join the bootcamp is because my job often intersects with the IT Department. Therefore, I am interested and want to learn more about the world of coding. Although I am already married and have a child, I don't see it as an obstacle but rather a motivation. Once again, nice to meet you all, and I appreciate your guidance. Thank you.</p>
